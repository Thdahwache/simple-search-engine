       "'The error \"invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase\" often occurs due to improper formatting in your Docker command, particularly with the volume mapping. Here are some suggestions to resolve this issue:\\n\\n1. Ensure that your paths are formatted correctly:\\n   - Move your data to a folder without spaces. For example, instead of using “C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/…”, try “C:/git/…”.\\n   \\n2. Use lowercase names for your repository and volume names throughout your command. Docker requires these to be lowercase.\\n\\n3. When specifying the volume, try one of the following syntax options:\\n   - `-v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n   - `-v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\\n   - Use winpty in front of your command if you are on Windows: `winpty docker run [...]`.\\n\\n4. If issues persist, consider using quotes around your volume paths:\\n   - For example: `-v \"/c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`.\\n\\n5. As a last resort, if you still encounter problems, you might want to use a volume name instead of a path:\\n   - Use `-v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`.\\n\\nBy ensuring that your repository and volume names are lowercase and correctly formatted, you should be able to resolve this error.'"

In this case, try using a different port, such as 5431, if you have mapped your Docker container to that port. You can change your connection string accordingly, for example:\\n   ```\\n   engine = create_engine(\\'postgresql://root:root@localhost:5431/ny_taxi\\')\\n   ```\\n\\n3. If you have a local PostgreSQL installation, it\\'s advisable to verify if it’s running and potentially causing conflicts. Stopping that service should help resolve the issue. \\n\\nMake sure to check if the correct PostgreSQL service is running by executing `docker ps` to see if your container is up and running. If the problem persists after these steps, please check for any additional configurations or errors that could be affecting the connection.'"
